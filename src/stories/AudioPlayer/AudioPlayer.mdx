A component for playing audio with a waveform visualization. This component integrates an equalizer visualization and allows users to play, pause, and interact with the audio in a visually engaging manner.

<Meta title="Components/AudioPlayer" component={AudioPlayer} />

## Overview

The `AudioPlayer` component is designed to provide an interactive way to play audio while displaying a waveform visualization. It supports customizable styles and properties, making it versatile for different use cases.

## Features

- üéµ **Waveform visualization**: Displays the audio waveform dynamically.
- ‚èØ **Play/Pause control**: Users can toggle playback.
- üîä **Volume control**: Adjust audio volume dynamically.
- üñº **Image & Quote support**: Can display an image and a short text description.
- üìÇ **Flexible Data Input**: Accepts an object with `id`, `name`, `quote`, `imgSrc`, and `audioSrc`.

## Usage

To use the `AudioPlayer` component in your project, import it and pass the required props.

```jsx
import { AudioPlayer } from '@times/graphics-components';

<AudioPlayer 
  data={{
    id: '1',
    name: 'Sample Audio',
    quote: 'This is a sample audio player.',
    imgSrc: 'sample-image',
    audioSrc: 'sample-audio'
  }}
/>
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the `audioSrc` points to a valid audio file (e.g., `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`).
- The `imgSrc` should be a valid image file accessible in the project.
- If no `quote` is provided, the component will still function correctly without displaying a description.

This component is designed to be flexible and can be styled further using styled-components or external CSS to fit different UI requirements.
